# Project Intelligence: AI-Powered Mental Health Support System

## Project Patterns

### Code Organization
- Use modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Organize code by feature/module rather than by technical function
- Keep UI components separate from business logic
- Maintain consistent file naming conventions across the project

### Development Workflow
- Implement core modules first before extending to advanced features
- Use incremental development with regular testing
- Document code and design decisions as they are made
- Prioritize user privacy and data security in all implementations

### User Experience
- Focus on creating a safe, non-judgmental interface
- Ensure all interactions are empathetic and supportive
- Provide clear guidance and feedback to users
- Make emergency resources easily accessible at all times

## Technical Preferences

### Python Coding Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Prefer explicit over implicit code
- Document functions and classes with docstrings

### Streamlit Implementation
- Use Streamlit's session state for maintaining user context
- Organize UI into logical sections with clear headers
- Implement custom CSS for consistent styling
- Use callbacks for interactive components

### NLP Model Usage
- Prefer pre-trained models with fine-tuning for specific tasks
- Implement model caching to improve performance
- Use model quantization for deployment when possible
- Document model limitations and potential biases

## Project Intelligence

### Critical Implementation Paths
- User authentication and session management
- Secure storage of sensitive user data
- NLP model integration and performance optimization
- Crisis detection and emergency response protocols

### Known Challenges
- Balancing AI capabilities with ethical considerations
- Ensuring privacy while providing personalized support
- Managing resource-intensive NLP operations
- Integrating with external APIs with rate limits

### Evolution of Project Decisions
- Starting with core modules before expanding to more complex features
- Beginning with local deployment before moving to cloud
- Using SQLite for initial development before potential migration to Firebase
- Implementing basic NLP features before adding more sophisticated analysis

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Development Tools
- VSCode as the primary IDE
- Git for version control
- Virtual environment for dependency management
- pytest for testing

### Deployment Tools
- Docker for containerization (potential)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (potential)
- Cloud platform (AWS/Azure/Heroku) for hosting

### Monitoring Tools
- Logging framework for error tracking
- Performance monitoring for NLP models
- User feedback collection for continuous improvement
