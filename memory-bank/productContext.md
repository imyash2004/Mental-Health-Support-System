# Product Context: AI-Powered Mental Health Support System

## Why This Project Exists
This project aims to address the growing mental health crisis by providing accessible, AI-powered support to individuals who may not have immediate access to professional mental health services. It serves as both an early detection system and a supportive resource for those experiencing mental health challenges.

## Problems It Solves
- Limited access to mental health resources and professionals
- Stigma associated with seeking mental health support
- Delayed identification of mental health issues
- Lack of continuous monitoring and support between professional appointments

1. Users can take self-assessments to gauge their mental health status
2. An AI chatbot offers conversational support and guidance
3. Social media analysis detects early warning signs of mental health challenges
4. Users can schedule appointments with mental health professionals
5. A dashboard centralizes all user interactions and resources
6. A resource library educates users about mental health topics
7. Users can provide feedback to improve the platform
8. Emergency contact features offer immediate help during crises
