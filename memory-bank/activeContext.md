- Integration with provided datasets for mental health analysis
- Error handling and graceful degradation for missing dependencies
- User interface development with Streamlit

## Recent Changes
- Implemented the Self-Assessment Module with interactive questionnaires and NLP-based analysis
- Developed the Chatbot Module with intent recognition and sentiment analysis
- Created the User Dashboard with visualization of assessment results and activity tracking
- Implemented the database layer using SQLite for data storage and retrieval
- Added utility functions for NLP operations
- Created a run script for easy application startup
- Implemented the Social Media Analysis Module with mental health concern detection
- Added support for running in simple mode without all dependencies
- Integrated with provided datasets (Full_Train_Data.tsv and Full_Test_Data.tsv)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Database Selection**: Using SQLite for current development
  - Implemented SQLite for simplicity and ease of setup
  - Will evaluate migration to Firebase for production if needed
  - Current focus is on functionality rather than scalability

- **NLP Model Selection**: Using Hugging Face Transformers
  - Implemented sentiment analysis using pre-trained models
  - Using pipeline abstraction for easy model swapping
  - Considering fine-tuning models for mental health-specific language

- **Deployment Strategy**: Planning for cloud deployment
  - Current focus is on local development and testing
  - Evaluating options for cloud deployment (Heroku, AWS, Azure)
  - Need to consider privacy and security requirements for health data

### User Experience Considerations
- **Privacy Controls**: Implemented basic privacy measures
  - User data is stored locally in SQLite database
  - No personal identifiers required beyond a username
  - Need to implement more robust privacy controls for production

- **Accessibility**: Implemented basic accessibility features
  - Using Streamlit's built-in accessibility features
  - Ensuring adequate color contrast in UI elements
  - Need to test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

- **Onboarding Experience**: Created simple onboarding flow
  - Home page explains available features
  - Clear navigation between modules
  - Need to enhance with guided tours or tutorials

### Ethical Considerations
- **Bias Mitigation**: Implemented basic bias mitigation
  - Using general-purpose pre-trained models
  - Avoiding demographic-based recommendations
  - Need to implement more robust bias detection and mitigation

- **Crisis Response**: Implemented basic crisis detection
  - Emergency keywords detection in chatbot
  - Emergency contact information in sidebar
  - Need to develop more sophisticated crisis detection algorithms
  - Need to implement proper escalation protocols
