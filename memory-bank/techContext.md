# Technical Context: AI-Powered Mental Health Support System

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages
- **Python**: Primary language for both frontend and backend development
  - Version: 3.8+ recommended for compatibility with all libraries

### Libraries and Frameworks
- **Frontend**:
  - **Streamlit**: For building interactive web applications
  - **Plotly/Matplotlib**: For data visualization
  - **HTML/CSS**: For custom styling and layout

- **NLP & Machine Learning**:
  - **spaCy**: For natural language processing tasks
  - **NLTK**: For text processing and linguistic analysis
  - **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa
  - **scikit-learn**: For traditional ML algorithms and pipelines
  - **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For custom deep learning models if needed

- **Data Management**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
  - **SQLAlchemy**: For database ORM (if using SQLite)
  - **Firebase-admin**: For Firebase integration (if chosen)

### APIs
- **Social Media APIs**:
  - Twitter API for tweet analysis
  - Reddit API for post and comment analysis
  
- **Calendar APIs**:
  - Google Calendar API for appointment scheduling
  
- **External Services**:
  - Mental health resources APIs (if available)
  - Emergency services integration

### Data Storage
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for local development
- **Firebase**: Cloud-based option for production
- **AWS S3/Azure Blob Storage**: For storing larger datasets or model files

### Privacy & Security
- **cryptography**: For encryption of sensitive data
- **python-dotenv**: For environment variable management
- **Flask-Security**: If extending beyond Streamlit for authentication

## Development Setup

### Local Development Environment
- Python 3.8+ with virtual environment (venv or conda)
- Git for version control
- VSCode or PyCharm as recommended IDEs
- Required packages installed via requirements.txt

### Version Control
- Git repository with branch protection for main/master
- Feature branch workflow for development
- Pull request reviews before merging

### Testing
- **pytest**: For unit and integration testing
- **Streamlit testing**: For UI component testing
- **Model validation**: For NLP/ML model evaluation

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Local development and testing
2. Staging environment deployment
3. User acceptance testing
4. Production deployment

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Constraints
- NLP models can be resource-intensive
  - Consider model quantization or distillation for production
  - Implement caching strategies for frequent operations
- Streamlit has limitations for high-concurrency applications
  - Consider scaling strategies for production

### Security Constraints
- Must comply with healthcare data regulations (even if not strictly medical)
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

### Integration Constraints
- Social media APIs have rate limits and authentication requirements
- Calendar APIs require OAuth setup and user permissions
- Emergency services integration needs careful implementation and testing

### Scalability Constraints
- Initial deployment may handle limited users
- Plan for horizontal scaling as user base grows
- Consider serverless architecture for certain components

## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies
- Streamlit for the entire UI layer
- Transformers library for NLP models
- Database system (SQLite/Firebase)

### External Services Dependencies
- Social media platforms API availability
- Calendar services API availability
- Cloud hosting service reliability

### Development Dependencies
- Testing frameworks
- Linting and code quality tools
- Documentation generators
