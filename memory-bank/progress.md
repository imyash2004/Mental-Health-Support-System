## Known Issues

### Technical Challenges
- Integration with social media APIs may require complex authentication
- NLP models for mental health analysis need careful validation
- Balancing privacy with functionality in data storage
- Ensuring real-time performance with resource-intensive NLP operations

### Ethical Considerations
- Need to establish clear boundaries for AI-based support vs. professional help
- Ensuring the system doesn't provide medical advice beyond its capabilities
- Addressing potential biases in training data and model outputs
- Developing appropriate crisis response protocols

### Implementation Risks
- Complexity of integrating multiple modules seamlessly
- Ensuring consistent user experience across different features
- Managing dependencies on external APIs and services
- Balancing development speed with quality and security requirements
